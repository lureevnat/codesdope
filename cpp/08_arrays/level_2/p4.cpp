/*
Problem:
Sorting refers to arranging data in a particular format. Sort an array of integers in ascending order. One of the algorithm is selection sort. Use below explanation of selection sort to do this.
INITIAL ARRAY :
2	3	1	45	15
First iteration : Compare every element after first element with first element and if it is larger then swap. In first iteration, 2 is larger than 1. So, swap it.
1	3	2	45	15
Second iteration : Compare every element after second element with second element and if it is larger then swap. In second iteration, 3 is larger than 2. So, swap it.
1	2	3	45	15
Third iteration : Nothing will swap as 3 is smaller than every element after it.
1	2	3	45	15
Fourth iteration : Compare every element after fourth element with fourth element and if it is larger then swap. In fourth iteration, 45 is larger than 15. So, swap it.
1	2	3	15	45
